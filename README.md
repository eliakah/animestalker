This is a personal project to test the features of python as a substitute to PHP for backend via flask. 

The Website will use the google books library to allow users to follow and/or get updates on new books by authors. 
It will also give access to available book listings with prices and link to Google and/or Amazon. 
The aim is to build a simple, intuitive website which is secure and also easy on the eyes.
